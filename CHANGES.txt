Pyrad 1.0
=========

* Fixed a timeout handling problem in the client: after receiving an
  invalid reply the current time was not updated, possibly leading to
  the client blocking forever.

* Switch to setuptools, allowing pyrad to be distributed as an egg
  via the python package index.

* Add unit tests.

* Use absolute instead of relative imports.

* Sockets are now opened with SO_REUSEADDR enabled to allow for faster
  restarts.
