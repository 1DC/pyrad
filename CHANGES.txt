Pyrad 1.0
=========

* The default dictionary for Server instances was shared between all instances,
  possibly leading to unwanted data pollution. Each Server now gets its own
  dict instance if none is passed in to the constructor.

* Fixed a timeout handling problem in the client: after receiving an
  invalid reply the current time was not updated, possibly leading to
  the client blocking forever.

* Switch to setuptools, allowing pyrad to be distributed as an egg
  via the python package index.

* Add unit tests.

* Use absolute instead of relative imports.

* Sockets are now opened with SO_REUSEADDR enabled to allow for faster
  restarts.
